= Timbuctoo default GUI

This project contains a few javascript applications that allow you to do some sensible things with timbuctoo.

 * A generic edit client that will use the timbuctoo provided metadata to render a basic editing form
 * A generic search client that will generate a search interface based on the metadata that timbuctoo and solr provide. It is tested with the timbuctoo-faceted-search-indexer
 * A multicollection search client. Which is similar to the previous one, but instead of searching one dataset, you search through all of them at once
 * An upload GUI and start page that provides an entry point to the other GUI's and allows you to upload data into timbuctoo
